# ETS TUR CASE STUDY
The application greets the user with a list screen. When the page is first loaded, the hotels are listed according to the rule that the last entry must go to the top, and when the user adds a new hotel, the added hotel is shown at the top.
The user can give points to hotels with increase points button or reduce points with the decrease points button.
When the user adds a new hotel, he/she sees the added message on the button.
If input field is empty add button will be non-clickable.
